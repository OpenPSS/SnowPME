# Info about external libaries

monosgen-2.0.lib, eglib.lib, etc are built from https://github.com/OpenPSS/pss-mono 
which itself is a slightly modified (to actually build, and to port to MSVC2022) version of Sony's original Fork of Mono for PSM.
There should be no problems using this, as it is licensed under the GPLv2 as well.
