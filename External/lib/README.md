# Info about external libaries

monosgen-2.0.lib, eglib.lib, etc are built from https://github.com/OpenPSS/pss-mono 
which itself is a slightly modified (to actually build ..) version of Sony's original Fork of Mono for PSM.
There should be no problems using this, as it is licensed under the GPL .
