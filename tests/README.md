SnowPME Tests:

These are _NOT_ regular .NET projects; they are
PlayStation Mobile Project Files, expected to be built using 
the PlayStation Mobile SDK;

So you'll need the PlayStation Mobile SDK in order to compile them.
because of that, building tests can only be done on Windows for the time being.

See the actions page if you would like pre-built binaries.
